Bear in mind that the iterable object youâ€™ll get using the
unpacking operator * is not a list but a tuple.
A tuple is similar to a list in that they
both support slicing and iteration. However,
tuples are very different in at least one aspect:
###lists are mutable,###(what is meaning of mutable??)
while tuples are not mutable(search it!!!)
