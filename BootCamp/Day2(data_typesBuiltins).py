'''
day2 we will learn,

comments == anything that can be used to take a note
OR is used to eliminate a piece of code from performing actions
datatype == shows what type of data is present with us
variables == objects are used to store data ,
built-ins == say as humans we have gratitude , emotions , feelings
similarly python has things built intoo it 
'''
print('hello shyami ji')


# this is a comment
# we are printing the **STRING** named 'hello shyami ji'
x = 3
y = 4
# here x,y are variables ### RULES FOR VARIABLE TO BE EXPLAINED
## CHECK WHATS THE DATA TYPE
print(type(x))
print(x+y)
##print(builtin(x,y))

## STRING FUNCTIONS---
name = 'Dev'
Name = 'Adwait'
name2 = "yashika"
name3 = "raj"

print(type(name))
print(name+' '+Name)
## OR
print(name, '  ' , Name) 

print(name+" ",x+10)
print(x*name)
print(name,Name)
##chr,abs,int,float,str,MORE WILL BE EXPLORED ON THE WAY
